# ToDo Node API


## Prerequisites

You'll need NodeJs and MongoDB to run this app. The easiest way to install both is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

    $ brew install node mongodb

## Getting Started

After you've cloned this repo locally, run the following commands:

    $ npm run setup

You can run the app without installing dependencies and running tests with:

    $ npm start

You can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## Tests

Run the test suite with:

    $ npm test

Generate a test coverage report with:

    $ npm run coverage

This will save a HTML file to "backbone_marionette/coverage.html". If you have the app running locally, you can access it at [http://localhost:3000/coverage.html](http://localhost:3000/coverage.html).
